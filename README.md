# Countdown Timer Using React 
This project from [JavaScript30 challenge](https://javascript30.com), but I used react.

## A brief description of what this project does:
Using `state hook` when user click button or enter number of minutes, 
starting to countdown and calculate the time will be end.

When user enter new value or click button. Timer will be updated, and the end time.

I get help from [My Friend](https://github.com/Momenwael21), to remove old timer when there's a new timer.
